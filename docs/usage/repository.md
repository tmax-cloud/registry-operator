# `Repository` Usage

## What is it?

`Repository` is a resource including images. If you push images to registry, repository resource is automatically created.
You can see image list and delete images.

## How to delete image

**Note**: You should ensure that the registry is in `read-only` mode. When deleting images, execute garbage collection. If you were to upload an image while garbage collection is running, there is the risk that the imageâ€™s layers are mistakenly deleted leading to a corrupted image. [refer](https://docs.docker.com/registry/garbage-collection/#more-details-about-garbage-collection)

* Delete all images of the repository
  1) delete the repository resource

* Delete some images of the repository
  1) edit repository
  2) set `spec.versions.delete` field to `true`

## Result

* State(status.signerKeyState.created)
  * true: Succeeded in creating signer key
  * false: Failed to create signer key

* Created Subresource Name
  * SignerKey: {IMAGE_SIGNER_NAME}
